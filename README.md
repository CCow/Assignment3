#Power went out in my house around 11:20pm and I was unable to commit for a final time until I got on my phone and remembered as best I could
#10/30 3:17 pm I got home during my break and the power had just been restored. My most recent commit (main, sntax.cpp, and input) were all completed last night before the blackout occured. If this results in me having to use another late day I understand.
